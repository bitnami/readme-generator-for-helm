# kubewatch

[kubewatch](https://github.com/bitnami-labs/kubewatch) is a Kubernetes watcher that currently publishes notification to Slack. Run it in your k8s cluster, and you will get event notifications in a slack channel.

## TL;DR

```console
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install my-release bitnami/kubewatch
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a kubewatch deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.1.0

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release bitnami/kubewatch
```

The command deploys kubewatch on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Create a Slack bot

Open [https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) to create a new Slack bot.
The API token can be found on the edit page (it starts with `xoxb-`).

Invite the Bot to your channel by typing `/join @name_of_your_bot` in the Slack message area.

### Adding extra environment variables

In case you want to add extra environment variables (useful for advanced operations like custom init scripts), you can use the `extraEnvVars` property.

```yaml
extraEnvVars:
  - name: LOG_LEVEL
    value: DEBUG
```

Alternatively, you can use a ConfigMap or a Secret with the environment variables. To do so, use the `extraEnvVarsCM` or the `extraEnvVarsSecret` values.

### Sidecars and Init Containers

If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as the Kubewatch app (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the `sidecars` config parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

```yaml
sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
       containerPort: 1234
```

Similarly, you can add extra init containers using the `initContainers` parameter.

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
        containerPort: 1234
```

### Deploying extra resources

There are cases where you may want to deploy extra objects, such a ConfigMap containing your app's configuration or some extra deployment with a micro service used by your app. For covering this case, the chart allows adding the full specification of other objects using the `extraDeploy` parameter.

### Setting Pod's affinity

This chart allows you to set your custom affinity using the `affinity` parameter. Find more information about Pod's affinity in the [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity).

As an alternative, you can use of the preset configurations for pod affinity, pod anti-affinity, and node affinity available at the [bitnami/common](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common#affinities) chart. To do so, set the `podAffinityPreset`, `podAntiAffinityPreset`, or `nodeAffinityPreset` parameters.

## Upgrading

### To 3.0.0

- Chart labels were adapted to follow the [Helm charts standard labels](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/labels/#standard-labels).
- This version also introduces `bitnami/common`, a [library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/#helm) as a dependency. More documentation about this new utility could be found [the github repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/common#bitnami-common-library-chart). Please, make sure that you have updated the chart dependencies before executing any upgrade.

Consequences:

- Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. To upgrade to `3.0.0`, install a new release of the Kubewatch chart.

### To 2.0.0

[On November 13, 2020, Helm v2 support was formally finished](https://github.com/helm/charts#status-of-the-project), this major version is the result of the required changes applied to the Helm Chart to be able to incorporate the different features added in Helm v3 and to be consistent with the Helm project itself regarding the Helm v2 EOL.

#### What changes were introduced in this major version?

- Previous versions of this Helm Chart use `apiVersion: v1` (installable by both Helm 2 and 3), this Helm Chart was updated to `apiVersion: v2` (installable by Helm 3 only). In the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-apiversion-field) you can find more information about the `apiVersion` field.
- The different fields present in the *Chart.yaml* file has been ordered alphabetically in a homogeneous way for all the Bitnami Helm Charts

#### Considerations when upgrading to this version

- If you want to upgrade to this version from a previous one installed with Helm v3, you shouldn't face any issues
- If you want to upgrade to this version using Helm v2, this scenario is not supported as this version doesn't support Helm v2 anymore
- If you installed the previous version with Helm v2 and wants to upgrade to this version with Helm v3, please refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/#migration-use-cases) about migrating from Helm v2 to v3

### To 1.0.0

Helm performs a lookup for the object based on its group (apps), version (v1), and kind (Deployment). Also known as its GroupVersionKind, or GVK. Changing the GVK is considered a compatibility breaker from Kubernetes' point of view, so you cannot "upgrade" those objects to the new GVK in-place. Earlier versions of Helm 3 did not perform the lookup correctly which has since been fixed to match the spec.

In <https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/17285> the `apiVersion` of the deployment resources was updated to `apps/v1` in tune with the api's deprecated, resulting in compatibility breakage.

This major version signifies this change.
